        Gemse is a MathML editor controlled by keyboard only. It has different 
        modes, similar to the text editor vi. Basically, it lets you edit the 
        XML structure of MathML. The formula is shown in different ways at the 
        same time: As rendered equation, as nested boxes and as XML source. It 
        is written in JavaScript and builds upon Mozilla. It can be installed as 
        a Firefox extension, XULRunner application or directly be run in 
        Firefox.
