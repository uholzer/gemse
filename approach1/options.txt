Thoughts:

1. Options must be registered somehow, so the user can be informed
when she tries to set an option that does not exist.
2. Their must be a way to validate the options values, so the user can
be informed immediately if he tries to set an option to an invalid
value.
3. On the user's side, option names and option values are just
strings.
4. Perhaps it is best to let a mode class declare the options its
uses. For exmaple the editMode could have a hash editMode.gemseOptions
that describes all options it recognizes.
5. Modes may share the same options.
6. Should the modes stay seperate, or would it make sense to put the
description of all options into one file?
7. How to handle default values? In all mode spearate or somehow
centralized?
8. How to handle synonymes, that is, options that have more than one
name?
