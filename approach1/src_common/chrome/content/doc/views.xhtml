<h1>Views</h1>

<p>This is an incomplete overview of the available views and viewsets.
If you know XUL, you can edit the viewsets defined in
<code>editor.xul</code>.</p>

<h3>NTNView</h3>

<p>If you work with Content MathML, this view renders your formula as
Presentation MathML in real time. It is part of viewset 5. It uses
JOMDoc, which is written in Java. Because of this, you have to 
<a href="java.xhtml">make some preparations</a>. When you are ready,
you can start Gemse and switch to viewset 5 by entering
<kbd>:viewset 5&enter;</kbd>.</p>

<p>By default, only the notation definitions bundled with JOMDoc are
used. However, notation sources can be configured manually. If the
formula originates from an OMDoc document, notations can be collected
from there as well as from its imports. The following options can be
set to customize the behaviour:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>NTNView.notations</code></dt>
<dd>A space-serparated list of notation sources. Each source consists
of a type (one or more uppercase letters) from the list below and an
optional argument which is usually an URI. The default value for this
option is <code>B</code>.
<ul>
<li>Type <code>B</code> without any arguments denotes the notations
bundled with JOMDoc.</li>
<li>Type <code>C</code> without any arguments causes content
dictionaries to be searched for notations. That is, if a symbol with
cdbase <code>http://example.com/somedir</code>, cd <code>foo</code> and name
<code>bar</code>, the document
<code>http://example.com/somedir/foo</code> is fetched and searched
for notation definitions for <code>foo</code> and for references to
such notation definitions. (This might not yet work as you expect it.
There is a problem with the default cdbase.)</li>
<li>Type <code>F</code> loads from the URL given as argument.</li>
<li>Type <code>D</code> looks in the document at the given URL for
notation definition and also searches all its imports. If the URL is
omitted, the value of the option <code>NTNView.theoryName</code> is
used.</li>
<li>Type <code>I</code> is useful when you load the equation from an
OMDoc document. In this case, the options
<code>NTNView.documentURI</code> and <code>NTNView.theoryName</code>
are set automatically to the right value should they not already have
been set. (Note that this is at the moment the same as <code>D</code>
with <code>NTNView.documentURI</code> set to the URL for the document
the formula is part of and <code>NTNView.theoryName</code> set to the
name of the innermost theory the formula is located in.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><code>NTNView.documentURI</code></dt>
<dd>The document the formula should be considered part of 
when choosing the notations used for rendering.</dd>

<dt><code>NTNView.theoryName</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the theory the formula should be considered to be
located in when choosing the notations used for rendering.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Only file and http URLs are supported for notation
sources. Contexts and tags are not yet supported.</p>
