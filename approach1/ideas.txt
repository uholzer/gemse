Random ideas
- Setting options with ":set key=value" like in vi
- Editing of multiple formulas in parallel (:next, :previous)
- Visual mode for selecting like in vi
- Selecting formulas to edit in a document with an XPath expression
- yank a selection and put it at another place

Movement
h  previous sibling
l  next sibling
j  first child
J  last child?
k  parent

Commands
i  Insert before marked element
a  Insert after
I  Insert before first element of this nesting level
A  Insert after last element of nesting level
x  Remove element (and its descendants) under cursor
r  Puts mrow around selection
f  for fences?
s  Removes element and takes all its childs as new childs (strip)
y  yank
p  put
P  put
u  undo (and redo?)

Selectors
l  next sibling
h  previous sibling


Insert mode
How the insert mode should work is a difficult question. Perhaps there
should be multiple insert modes. (Changing with space?)
To be considered:
- QMath (would be really cool, but too difficult to integrate because
  of its semantic nature?)
- How does it WME?
- infix notation
- Templates
- Look at Amaya
- Linear input
- Recursive input
