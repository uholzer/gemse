<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h2>1.0.2</h2>

<p>The surround feature has been added to the insert mode. It allows
you for examlpe to first write the base of a potency and then hit
<kbd>^</kbd> later on.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happened that inserting a wrong
command screwed up the whole editor since it was no longer possible to
clear the input box. Now clearing the input box using <kbd>&esc;</kbd>
should always work.</p>

<p>Some commands have been added and the documentation
has been improved.</p>

<h2>1.0.1</h2>

<p>Many commands have been added. The insert mode supports more
elements. More documentation, including a short introcution to
Presentation MathML has been added. This is still a development
release tought to get feedback from users.</p>

<h2>1.0.0</h2>

<p>This first release shows the idea behind Gemse. It is still missing
many features. It is not a production release but thought for
collecting feedback from potential users.</p>
