<h1>Gemse Base</h1>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>First, Gemse is only useful to people who can see. On the other
hand, I want that also people who can see something but still are
visually impaired, for example because of color blindness. The
solution is to provide different stylesheets. In the future their will
be a monochrome stylesheet and perhaps also a black/white one.</p>

<p>Persons who have problems using a keyboard can perhaps still use
gemse. The names of the commands can be adapted. The requirement is
that the user can insert unicode characters in some way. However,
Gemse can not be used with a pointing device. (Except if you use the
pointing device to stear an on-screen keyboard which generates unicode
input for Gemse.)</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Somehow you must be able to insert all the unicode characters you
need. For example, if you need a ∀ in a formula, you must be able to
insert it. Gemse does not contain a way to turn something like
<code>forall</code> into a ∀. If you need that (for example because
you do not have a ∀ key), you have to configure your operating system
so it can do that for you. I do not know about Windows or Mac, but for
Linux, I can provide <a href="http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2008-03/mathinput/">a solution</a>.
</p>

<p>In the future, such functionality will perhaps be integrated into
Gemse. It should not be too difficult. Of course, directly inserting
any unicode character will stay possible.</p>
