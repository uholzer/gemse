<h1>Gemse Base</h1>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<p>First, Gemse is only useful to people who can see. On the other
hand, I want that also people who can see something but still are
visually impaired, for example because of color blindness. The
solution is to provide different stylesheets. In the future their will
be a monochrome stylesheet and perhaps also a black/white one.</p>

<p>Persons who have problems using a keyboard can perhaps still use
gemse. The names of the commands can be adapted. The requirement is
that the user can insert unicode characters in some way. However,
Gemse can not be used with a pointing device. (Except if you use the
pointing device to stear an on-screen keyboard which generates unicode
input for Gemse.)</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>Somehow you must be able to insert all the unicode characters you
need. For example, if you need a ∀ in a formula, you must be able to
insert it. Gemse does not contain a way to turn something like
<code>forall</code> into a ∀. If you need that (for example because
you do not have a ∀ key), you have to configure your operating system
so it can do that for you. I do not know about Windows or Mac, but for
Linux, I can provide <a href="http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2008-03/mathinput/">a solution</a>.
</p>

<p>In the future, such functionality will perhaps be integrated into
Gemse. It should not be too difficult. Of course, directly inserting
any unicode character will stay possible.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Gemse requires Mozilla. That means, you either need Firefox 3 or
you have to use XULRunner. Unfortunately, Gemse is not yet prepared
for XULRunner, but I believe it is easy to do that.</p>

<p>You can run the demo of Gemse directly from its website using
Firefox 3. Also, you can download the package, unpack it into some
directory and open the file <code>editor.xhtml</code> in Firefox 3.
Both variants have the drawback that Gemse will run with restricted
permissions. This mainly means that you are unable to use the save and
load functions.</p>

<p>You can also put Gemse into the chrome of your Firefox. Put in the
chrome directory a file named <code>gemse.manifest</code> containing</p>

<pre>content gemse file:///home/urs/p/gemse/approach1/ contentaccessible=yes</pre>

<p>Of course, you have to replace <code>file:///home/urs/p/gemse/approach1/</code>
with the name of the directory where you unpacked the Gemse package. I
unpacked it somewhere in my home directory, but of course, you can
also unpack it somewhere in the chrome directory. Then you can enter
<code>chrome://gemse/content/editor.xhtml</code> in the adress bar of
Firefox and the editor opens up with the full privileges. You will now
be able to load and save files where you want. <em>Be aware that you
should not put untrusted code into the chrome of your browser. Also
note that Gemse's code is very young and not well tested and as such
might do damage, especially if you use the save command not
carefully. (For example, it does not ask before overwriting existing
files.)</em></p>

<p>However, by installing Gemse into the chrome, you can enable a
powerful feature: Gemse provides a (so called) overlay for Firefox. It
adds an entry to the context menu called <q>edit in Gemse</q>. So, if
you open the context menu on a <code>math</code> element and select
this new entry, it gets
opened in Gemse. There you can edit it and save it, which puts your
changes into the document and saves the document to disk. You can also
open the context menu on any other element of your document. In such a
case, all <code>math</code> elements which are contained in (i.e. are
descendants of) the said element are loaded. You can also select a
part of the document and open the context menu. In this case, all
(partially) selected math elements are loaded. If you want to activate
this feature, you have to put an additional line in you
<code>gemse.manifest</code>. You can look into the manifest file
packaged with gemse, in order to find out how it has to look like.</p>
