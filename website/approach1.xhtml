<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML. Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
Presentation MathML. It is controled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox 3. It perhaps also runs in other browsers.
There is no release ready up to now.</p>

<p>The project makes progress (as of January 2009). However, the most
important parts, the handling of the different command types and the
comands itself in edit mode as well as the entire insert mode are
still missing.</p>
