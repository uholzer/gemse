<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML. Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
Presentation MathML. It is controlled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox 3.</p>

<p>Finally version 1.0.4 is ready with huge internal improvements.
But be aware, that this version still is not a production release,
its intention is only to get feedback from potential users.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Firefox 3, <a href="demo/editor.xhtml">try the
demo</a>.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="demo/doc/">documentation</a> or the 
<a href="demo/doc/releasenotes.xhtml">release notes</a></li>
<li>Download <a href="releases/gemse-1-0-4.zip">Gemse 1.0.4 as zip file</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>What it is and what it is not</h2>

<p>Gemse is an interactive editor for Presentation MathML, completely
steered by keyboard. But let us look at that a bit more detailed:</p>

<p>Presentation MathML is</p>

<ul>
<li>too verbose to edit using a text editor</li>
<li>represents nicely the structure of a formula</li>
<li>adapted to be used on the web</li>
<li>by far not as powerful as LaTeX, since it is not a typesetting
laguage</li>
<li>does not encode the meaning of a formula, just its
appeareance</li>
<li>uses Unicode (so, no need to include
some stupid package just to get that character)</li>
</ul>

<p>Gemse is</p>

<ul>
<li>completely controlled by keyboard, a mouse is useless</li>
<li>similar to Vim</li>
<li>uses Mozilla (only runs in Firefox 3 or higher at the moment)</li>
<li>not mature, as it is a young project</li>
<li>fun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>And the licence? I am not yet shure which licenses I am going to
use. However, I am shure that Gemse will be available under multiple
licences. GPL version 2 and 3 will definitely be an option.</p>
