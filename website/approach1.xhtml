<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation and Content MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML, Content MathML or OpenMath.
Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
MathML or OpenMath. It is controlled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox XULRunner. (In both cases, version 10
is recommended but older or newer releases maybe work as well.)</p>

<p>Gemse finally has become a useful tool. All planned features for
version 1 have been implemented. However, there are many bugs for
sure.</p>

<p>The current release is 1.0.16. Read the
<a href="demo/doc/releasenotes.xhtml">release notes</a> or the 
<a href="demo/doc/index.xhtml">documentation</a>. (Unfortunately, the
tutorial can not be read even on Firefox, because Mozilla deactivated
remote XUL.)
Visit the <a href="https://trac.mathweb.org/gemse/">wiki and the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Download and install</h2>

<p>You can choose from the following variants:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="releases/gemseFirefoxExtension-1-0-16.xpi">Install Gemse as
Firefox extension</a>. Then you can open it by
visiting <code>chrome://gemse/content/editor.xul</code> and read its
documentation at <code>chrome://gemse/content/doc/index.xhtml</code>.</li>
<li>Get <a href="releases/gemseXULRunnerApplication-1-0-16.zip">Gemse
as XULRunner application</a> and run it with XULRunner.</li>
<li>Get the <a href="releases/gemse_src-1-0-16.tar.gz">whole source</a>. (As
tar ball, since the directory structure I use for development makes
use of symbolic links.)</li>
<li>Clone the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository with
<pre>git clone http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2008-12/gemse/repo/gemse_public.git gemse</pre>
or the <a href="https://github.com/uholzer/gemse">repository on github</a> with
<pre>git clone https://github.com/uholzer/gemse.git</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(Unfortunately, since Mozilla deactivated remote XUL, the online
version and the minimal version are no longer available.)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Gemse does not look for updates automatically, so you
have to check this page periodically.</p>

<h2>What it is and what it is not</h2>

<p>Gemse is an interactive editor for MathML and OpenMath, completely
steered by keyboard. But let us look at that a bit more detailed:</p>

<p>Presentation MathML</p>

<ul>
<li>is too verbose to edit using a text editor</li>
<li>represents nicely the structure of a formula</li>
<li>is adapted to be used on the web</li>
<li>is by far not as powerful as LaTeX, since it is not a typesetting
laguage</li>
<li>does not encode the meaning of a formula, just its
appearance</li>
<li>uses Unicode (so, no need to include
some stupid package just to get that character)</li>
</ul>

<p>Content MathML and OpenMath (which are very similar)</p>

<ul>
<li>represent the meaning of a formula, not its appearance</li>
<li>can be automatically converted to Presentation MathML in most
situations, given there are useful notation definitions</li>
<li>can be cumbersome to edit by hand, since you easily loose the
overview. Gemse helps here a little.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gemse</p>

<ul>
<li>is completely controlled by keyboard, a mouse is useless</li>
<li>is similar to Vim</li>
<li>is based on the Mozilla toolkit</li>
<li>is fun</li>
</ul>
