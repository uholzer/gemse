<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML. Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
Presentation MathML. It is controled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox 3.</p>

<p>The project has continued faster than expected. You can already try
version 1.0.2. But be aware, that this version does not yet contain
all features and may contain many bugs. It is not a production release,
its intention is only to get feedback from potential users.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Firefox 3, <a href="demo/editor.xhtml">try the
demo</a>.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="demo/doc/">documentation</a> or the 
<a href="demo/doc/releasenotes.xhtml">release notes</a></li>
<li>Download <a href="releases/gemse-1-0-2.zip">Gemse 1.0.2 as zip file</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the licence? I am not yet shure which licenses I am going to
use. However, I am shure that Gemse will be available under multiple
licences. GPL version 2 and 3 will definitely be an option.</p>
