<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation and Content MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML, Content MathML or OpenMath.
Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
MathML or OpenMath. It is controlled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox 3 and in XULRunner 1.9.</p>

<p>Gemse finally has become a useful tool. The most important features
have been implemented. However,
the newest version still is not a production release,
its intention is only to get feedback from interested users.</p>

<p>The current release is 1.0.13. Read the
<a href="demo/doc/releasenotes.xhtml">release notes</a> or the 
<a href="demo/doc/index.xhtml">documentation</a>.
Visit the <a href="https://trac.mathweb.org/gemse/">wiki and the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Download and install</h2>

<p>You can choose from the following variants:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Firefox 3, <a href="demo/editor.xul">try the
online demo</a>.</li>
<li><a href="releases/gemseFirefoxExtension-1-0-13.xpi">Install Gemse as
Firefox extension</a>. Then you can open it by
visiting <code>chrome://gemse/content/editor.xul</code> and read its
documentation at <code>chrome://gemse/content/doc/index.xhtml</code>.</li>
<li>Get <a href="releases/gemseXULRunnerApplication-1-0-13.zip">Gemse
as XULRunner application</a> and run it with XULRunner 1.9.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="releases/gemseMinimal-1-0-13.zip">minimal version</a> with 
less weird directory structure, intended to be
run outside of Firefox chrome, like the demo. Just unzip it and open
<code>editor.xul</code> in Firefox. (If you do that, not
all commands will work since Firefox prevents access to your system.)</li>
<li>Get the <a href="releases/gemse_src-1-0-13.tar.gz">whole source</a>. (As
tar ball, since the directory structure I use for development makes
use of symbolic links.)</li>
<li>Clone the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository from 
<code>http://www.andonyar.com/rec/2008-12/gemse/repo/gemse_public.git</code></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> Firefox can not yet find updates of Gemse on its own, so you
have to check this page periodically. I will hopefully get around to fix that soon.</p>

<p><em>Important:</em> Loading and saving of equations has been
reimplemented not long ago, so it may be buggy. Please be
careful and make a backup of your document before you edit it with
Gemse. Also, please report any misfeatures back to me.
However, if you use the demo or the minimal version, you are on the
save side, since Firefox prevents access to your system.</p>

<h2>Bugs and more Help: <a href="https://trac.mathweb.org/gemse/">Trac site</a></h2>

<p>If you want to learn more about Gemse than the documentation
bundled with Gemse can teach you, take a look at

There you can also send in bug reports.</p>

<h2>What it is and what it is not</h2>

<p>Gemse is an interactive editor for MathML and OpenMath, completely
steered by keyboard. But let us look at that a bit more detailed:</p>

<p>Presentation MathML</p>

<ul>
<li>is too verbose to edit using a text editor</li>
<li>represents nicely the structure of a formula</li>
<li>is adapted to be used on the web</li>
<li>is by far not as powerful as LaTeX, since it is not a typesetting
laguage</li>
<li>does not encode the meaning of a formula, just its
appearance</li>
<li>uses Unicode (so, no need to include
some stupid package just to get that character)</li>
</ul>

<p>Content MathML and OpenMath (which are very similar)</p>

<ul>
<li>represent the meaning of a formula, not its appearance</li>
<li>can be automatically converted to Presentation MathML in most
situations, given there are useful notation definitions</li>
<li>can be cumbersome to edit by hand, since you easily loose the
overview. Gemse helps here a little.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gemse</p>

<ul>
<li>is completely controlled by keyboard, a mouse is useless</li>
<li>is similar to Vim</li>
<li>uses Mozilla</li>
<li>is not mature, as it is a young project (but it makes progress)</li>
<li>is fun</li>
</ul>
