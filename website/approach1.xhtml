<h1>Gemse Approach 1: An editor for Presentation MathML</h1>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is an editor for mathematical formulas using
Presentation MathML. Unlike other editors, this one is neither intuitive
nor easy to learn and you must have a basic understanding of
Presentation MathML. It is controlled with the keyboard only, its user
interface is highly inspired by the text editor vi. The goal is to be
able to edit equations as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Gemse Approach 1 is implemented in JavaScript using DOM. It runs in
the webbrowser Firefox 3 and in XULRunner 1.9.</p>

<p>Gemse finally has become a useful tool. The most important features
have been implemented. However,
the newest version still is not a production release,
its intention is only to get feedback from interested users.</p>

<p>Read the
<a href="demo/doc/releasenotes.xhtml">release notes</a> or the <a
href="demo/doc/index.xhtml">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Download and install</h2>

<p>You can choose from the following variants:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Firefox 3, <a href="demo/editor.xul">try the
online demo</a>.</li>
<li><a href="releases/gemseFirefoxExtension-1-0-6.xpi">Install Gemse as
Firefox extension</a>. Then you can open it by
visiting <code>chrome://gemse/content/editor.xul</code> and read its
documentation at <code>chrome://gemse/content/doc/index.xhtml</code>.</li>
<li>Get <a href="releases/gemseXULRunnerApplication-1-0-6.zip">Gemse
as XULRunner application</a> and run it with XULRunner 1.9.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="releases/gemseMinimal-1-0-6.zip">minimal version</a> with 
less weird directory structure, intended to be
run outside of Firefox chrome, like the demo. Just unzip it and open
<code>editor.xul</code> in Firefox. (If you do that, not
all commands will work since Firefox prevents access to your system.)</li>
<li>Get the <a href="releases/gemse_src-1-0-6.tar.gz">whole source</a>. (As
tar ball, since the directory structure I use for development makes
use of symbolic links.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please be aware that Gemse is not yet mature, so it could cause
damage if not used with care. For example it does overwrite existing
files without asking when you save an equation. However, if you use
the demo or the minimal version, you are save, since Firefox prevents access to your
system.</p>

<h2>What it is and what it is not</h2>

<p>Gemse is an interactive editor for Presentation MathML, completely
steered by keyboard. But let us look at that a bit more detailed:</p>

<p>Presentation MathML is</p>

<ul>
<li>too verbose to edit using a text editor</li>
<li>represents nicely the structure of a formula</li>
<li>adapted to be used on the web</li>
<li>by far not as powerful as LaTeX, since it is not a typesetting
laguage</li>
<li>does not encode the meaning of a formula, just its
appeareance</li>
<li>uses Unicode (so, no need to include
some stupid package just to get that character)</li>
</ul>

<p>Gemse is</p>

<ul>
<li>completely controlled by keyboard, a mouse is useless</li>
<li>similar to Vim</li>
<li>uses Mozilla (only runs in Firefox 3 or higher at the moment)</li>
<li>not mature, as it is a young project</li>
<li>fun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>And the licence? I am not yet shure which licences I am going to
use. However, I am shure that Gemse will be available under multiple
licences. GPL version 2 and 3 will definitely be an option.</p>
