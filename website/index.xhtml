<h1>Gemse, the General Math Structure Editor</h1>

<p>The project Gemse has been started in the need for an editor
for mathematical formulas that is fast and can be controled by
keyboard only.</p>

<p>Actually, the first approach to this problem,
"<a href="approach1">Gemse Approach 1</a>",
is an editor for MathML. It is currently in development.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an editor that catches the semantics of
a formula, you should consider

Also take a look at <a href="http://wme.cs.kent.edu/mathedit/">MathEdit</a>.</p>
